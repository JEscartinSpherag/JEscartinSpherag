👋 Hey fellow programmers!  
🧑 My name is Jesús Escartín.  
💼 I'm the intern for microcomputer systems and networks at Spherag Tech IoT, and I'm excited to introduce you to my GitHub Readme!  
🔥 If you're looking for someone who loves computing as much as you do, you've found me!  
💻 Ever since I discovered my passion for programming, I haven't stopped learning and experimenting with new technologies.  
👨‍💻 Currently, I'm diving into the world of C# and Selenium in Visual Studio, and even though they sometimes make me sweat a bit, I'm enjoying every minute of the     experience.  
💪 I hope my contribution to the GitHub community is helpful and entertaining, and that together we can continue to learn and improve in this exciting world of programming.  
👀 See you in the code!
